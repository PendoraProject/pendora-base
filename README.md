# Pendora Base
Pendora Base is the framework that makes the language tick.
It exports both the data structures that are used creating build artifacts and the parsing implementation to create these data structures.
For more information, see the [Implementation Documentation](https://pendora-docs.web.app/developer_guide/introduction.html).
The parsing section maybe of interest to you.
